            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook the spaghetti. Cook the spaghetti in a generously-salted pot of boiling water until it is just one minute shy of being al dente. (al dente meaning firm when bitten without being hard or chalky)</li>
                <li>Sauté the garlic.  Meanwhile, about 3 minutes after you add the pasta to the boiling water, heat the olive oil in a large sauté pan over medium heat. Add the sliced garlic and crushed red pepper flakes and sauté for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the garlic is lightly golden.</li>
                <li>Toss the pasta in the sauce.  Once the pasta is ready to go, use tongs to transfer the pasta immediately to the sauté pan, along with 1/2 cup of the hot starchy pasta water. Toss the pasta continuously until it is evenly coated in the garlic sauce. If the sauce looks a bit too dry, add in another 1/4 cup of the starchy pasta water.</li>
		<li>Taste and season. Give the pasta a quick taste add an extra pinch of salt and/or crushed red pepper flakes if needed.</li>
		<li>Serve. Serve immediately while it’s nice and hot, garnished with any toppings that sound good</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <p>Have all of your ingredients ready to go. Things move fairly quickly once the pasta begins to cook, so I recommend having all of your ingredients laid out, chopped and ready to go.
It’s important that the garlic not burn. If turns lightly golden before the pasta is ready to go, just remove the pan from the heat until it’s time to add the pasta.
Don’t forget to salt that pasta water! You’ve heard me say it before, but this is the main time that you really get to season the pasta itself. So be sure to add a generous helping of sea salt to the water.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>balsamic vinegar</li>
                <li>3 whole ripe tomatoes, sliced thick</li>
                <li>12 oz. mozzarella cheese, sliced thick</li>
		<li>fresh basil leaves</li>
		<li>olive oil</li>
		<li>kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring the balsamic vinegar to a boil over medium-low heat in a small saucepan. Cook for 10 to 20 minutes, or until the balsamic has reduced to a thicker glaze. Remove it from the heat and transfer to a bowl or cruet. Allow to cool.</li>
                <li>When you're ready to serve, arrange tomato and mozzarella slices on a platter. Arrange basil leaves between the slices. Drizzle olive oil over the top of the salad, getting a little bit on each slice. Do the same with the balsamic reduction, making designs if you want. Store extra balsamic reduction in fridge for a later use.</li>
                <li>End with a sprinkling of kosher salt and black pepper. Serve as a lunch, with crusty bread, or serve alongside a beef main course for dinner.</li>
            </ol>
 <h2>Notes</h2>
            <p>use a simple balsamic reduction, which results in a pretty presentation and gorgeous flavor. Balsamic reduction is delicious on beef. Now, you’ll notice that on the moist/wet mozzarella, the balsamic reduction starts to seep and run (a watercolor effect)–but on the basil leaves and platter, it remains more of a semi-solid glaze. So if you’re artistic, you can create designs on the sides of your platter to really up the presentation factor.	</p>

<section id="recipe3">
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 to 3 medium very ripe bananas, peeled</li>
                <li>3 1/3 cup butter, unsalted or salted, melted</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
		<li>1 pinch salt</li>
		<li>3/4 cup sugar (1/2 cup if you would like it less sweet, 1 cup if more sweet)</li>
		<li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
		<li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 175°C:
Butter an 8x4-inch loaf pan.</li>
                <li>Mash the bananas and add the butter:
In a mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until completely smooth. Stir the melted butter into the mashed bananas.</li>
                <li>Mix in the remaining ingredients:
Mix in the baking soda and salt. Stir in the sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla extract. Mix in the flour.</li>
		<li>Bake the bread:
Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan. Bake for 55 to 65 minutes at 175°C, or until a toothpick or wooden skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. A few dry crumbs are okay; streaks of wet batter are not. If the outside of the loaf is browned but the center is still wet, loosely tent the loaf with foil and continue baking until the loaf is fully baked.</li>
		<li>Cool and serve:
Remove from oven and let cool in the pan for a few minutes. Then remove the banana bread from the pan and let cool completely before serving. Slice and serve. (A bread knife helps to make slices that aren't crumbly.)

Wrapped well, the banana bread will keep at room temperature for 4 days. For longer storage, refrigerate the loaf up to 5 days, or freeze it..</li>
            </ol>
 <h2>Notes</h2>
            <p>WARNING. There s a huge problem with this recipe. You will be sad if you don’t double it!!!! It is fantastic. Remember to double or triple the serving size depending on how many people will be eating.	</p>
